//! Compile-time configuration.
//!
//! `trouble` has some configuration settings that are set at compile time.
//!
//! They can be set in two ways:
//!
//! - Via Cargo features: enable a feature like `<name>-<value>`. `name` must be in lowercase and
//!   use dashes instead of underscores. For example. `l2cap-rx-queue-size-4`. Only a selection of values
//!   is available, check `Cargo.toml` for the list.
//! - Via environment variables at build time: set the variable named `TROUBLE_HOST_<value>`. For example
//!   `TROUBLE_HOST_L2CAP_RX_QUEUE_SIZE=1 cargo build`. You can also set them in the `[env]` section of `.cargo/config.toml`.
//!   Any value can be set, unlike with Cargo features.
//!
//! Environment variables take precedence over Cargo features. If two Cargo features are enabled for the same setting
//! with different values, compilation fails.
