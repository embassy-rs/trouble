= Performance

To achieve the best possible performance, some tuning is involved. Note this often has a trade-off of throughput, latency and power consumption,
so the ideal configuration depends on your application.

== Background

In order to understand what configurations need to be set and how, we will require some understanding of the Bluetooth hardware and lower layers of the software stack.

A Bluetooth controller, the actual physical radio, sends packets of data called the Protocol Data Unit (PDU). In Bluetooth
communication, there are a number of different PDUs used with different physical channels for different purposes such
as advertising and data transfer. These PDUs have different structures. For our example, we only need to focus on the

The structure of the Data Physical Channel PDU is shown below.

Since Bluetooth 4.2, the maximum size of the PDU payload, plus the MIC if included, has increased from 27 to 251 bytes.
The maximum size of the PDU to be used in a connection, also known as the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), is negotiated
between the central and peripheral device upon establishing a connection.
The length of this payload is described in the PDU header.

A data physical channel PDU payload can be a Logic Link (LL) Data PDU or a LL Control PDU.
These are differentiated by the LLID header bits.

For the purpose of these examples, we shall focus further on the LL data PDU.
The payload of an LL data PDU contains Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) data.

In a link:https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/HTML/Core-54/out/en/host/logical-link-control-and-adaptation-protocol-specification.html#UUID-3ec8360b-1e1c-07fa-7a2b-27eef555dda0[connection oriented channel], the L2CAP data has the following structure.

The L2CAP PDU length describes the length of the information payload.
The maximum size of the information payload is 65533 bytes.
This limit setting is known as the L2CAP MTU.
Notably, this can be larger than the maximum size of the PDU payload.
L2CAP payloads larger than the maximum size of the PDU payload will be fragmented into chunks no longer than the PDU MTU before being sent over the air.

The primary goal of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is to minimize energy consumption.
BLE achieves this efficiency by keeping the radio off for the majority of the time, and only activating it when necessary.
For instance, after a connection is established, data transfer occurs periodically during synchronized time windows called connection events.
These events are separated by a negotiated time interval known as the connection interval.
During each connection event, the central and peripheral radios briefly wake up to exchange data packets and then return to an idle state until the next event.
This scheduled radio activity significantly reduces power usage compared to keeping the radio active continuously.

Since Bluetooth 5.0, Bluetooth controllers can double the symbol transmission rate from 1Mbps, known as 1M PHY, to
2Mbps, known as 2M PHY.

By understanding these configurations, we can adjust them to prioritize throughput over energy conservation.

== Default configurations

A default BLE configuration optimised for backwards compatibility and energy conservation, like the `ble_l2cap` examples,
would have a PDU size of 27 and a high connection interval.

The Bluetooth packet timeline below depicts multiple packets being sent in one connection event.
Blue represents useful data being sent.

The Bluetooth packet timeline below depicts bluetooth packets sent in different connection events.
Notice the white gaps in both figures.
To maximise throughput, we need to increase the ratio of blue in these diagrams.

The following sections describe how these configurations can be modified to maximise throughput.

=== Data Length Extension

Since Bluetooth 4.2, the maximum PDU size has increased from 27 to 251.
For better throughput, a higher PDU should be used as
1. there will be fewer header bytes per packet of data
2. more data is sent in one go, reducing the waiting time required between sending consecutive packets.

To set this we use the HCI command link:https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/HTML/Core-54/out/en/host-controller-interface/host-controller-interface-functional-specification.html#UUID-242f8446-8cd1-8293-a341-b09354bae550[`LeSetDataLength`] with `tx_octets = 251` and `tx_time = 2120`.

NOTE: This option is only available on the 1M and 2M phy.

=== L2CAP MTU

Choosing the correct value for the L2CAP MTU can have a significant impact on throughput.
If an L2CAP payload is larger than the PDU by 1 byte, this will be fragmented into two packets, one of size PDU and the other of size 1.
The following diagram shows the packets when PDU = 251 and L2CAP MTU = 252.

.Effects of suboptimal settings for PDU (251) and L2CAP MTU (252)
image::PDU-251_L2CAP-MTU-252.png[]


Hence, it is important to choose an L2CAP MTU value that can neatly fit into a number of PDU packets.
If the PDU length is set to 251, then the L2CAP MTU should be set to some multiple of this.

One other thing to note is that an L2CAP payload has 6 bytes of header.
This means that for a smaller L2CAP MTU, more bytes are used for headers than service data.

The maximum size of the L2CAP MTU is 65533, however, this may be limited by the controller resources, see the next section.

=== HCI controller configuration

The size of the PDU and the maximum number of fragments an L2CAP PDU can be broken into may be limited by the HCI firmware.
For example, in the serial-hci example, the HCI UART Bluetooth dongle firmware's default has 3 27-byte long buffers.
Hence, L2CAP PDUs greater than $ 27 \times 3 $ cannot be handled by the HCI firmware.
These firmware configurations may be improved.
If this is required for your target, check the target's example readme for more information on how to do this.

To calculate the maximum L2CAP MTU allowed by the controller, we can multiply the size and number of available buffers.
At its max, the HCI UART Bluetooth dongle firmware can have 20 251-byte long buffers.
Hence, the largest possible L2CAP MTU supported by this firmware is 5020 bytes.

However, it can be beneficial not set the L2CAP MTU to this maximum.
If the L2CAP MTU is set to the maximum buffer space available to the controller,
the host will only be able to send a new packet once the all the buffers are free.
This might cause the controller to switch off the radio until the next connection event once it has exhausted all the buffers,
before receiving the next batch from the host. See diagram below.

.1M PHY and L2CAP MTU set to 5020, consuming all controller buffers
image::L2CAP_MTU_uses_all_buffers.png[]

However, if we allow a few extra buffers, the host will be able to send more data to the controller before it
exhausts the data from the previous message.
This will cause the radio to stay awake.

.2M PHY and L2CAP MTU set to 2510, consuming half of the controller buffers
image::L2CAP_MTU_uses_half_of_buffers.png[]

The change from 1M PHY in the above figures is denoted by the doubling of the packet height.

=== Service Data Unit size

If it can be controlled, such as when having a lot of available data to send, we can improve our throughput by sending
data that neatly fits in L2CAP payloads.

Since an L2CAP payload has 4 bytes of header + 2 bytes for a connection oriented channel payload, this can be achieved by sending data that is a multiple of the L2CAP MTU - 6.

=== Connection Interval

If the L2CAP MTU is set such that it allows the host to constantly keep some controller buffers occupied, the controller will keep sending data until just before a new connection event is scheduled.

In this scenario, it makes sense to use a longer connection interval, however, this would increase latency and
possibly lower throughput in noisy environments as when connections are dropped, the radio will idle until the next connection event.

=== PHY

Once the host and controller are set up to continuously send data, the final major improvement is to set up the radios to use 2M PHY.

This allows the radio to send at twice the data rate compared to 1M phy. In noisy environments, however, the s2coded or s8coded phy may be more
appropriate.
