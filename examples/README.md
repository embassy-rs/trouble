# Examples

The example logic can be found in the `app` directory.
The different target directories contain the required setup code for the different targets.
Any target specific documentation can be found in the respective target directory.

## High throughput example

The high throughput example showcases optimum configuration settings for achieving high throughput.
Throughput of around 1.4 Mbps have been measured with some of the more aggressive configurations.  
It is important to note that these configurations compromise on energy conservation.

This example requires specific hardware and HCI firmware configurations that can support the configurations used.
Any specific target requirements will be outlined in the target readme.

For more information on performance tuning, see the [documentation](https://embassy.dev/trouble/#_performance).
